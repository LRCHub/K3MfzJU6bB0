I was hoping
That I'd see you
I'd get to hug u
In the twenty twenties
Even though you'd
Rather not be
You'd be smiling
In the twenty twenties
Pretending that we're unaware
How bad things are
Like they're not there
No
The one who always had my back
Who fought my fights
Is backing down
But
I don't even know
I can't express how much
I thank you for the things
You've taught me all my life
You don't even know
How brave you were alive
I promise you'll always be with me
Even when they say you've died
Mom found the notes that
You have left
The things that
You have said
Oh god
The cookies are missing, just the taste
I'm missing your embrace
Oh god
Pretending everything is the same
Distracted by the things we say
But what about her?
What about her, now?
Who's to say you're better now
I'll make this song a pitch to god
So god, please
What about her, 'cause
I don't even know
I can't express how much
I thank you for the things
You've taught me all my life
You don't even know
How brave you were alive
I promise you'll always be with me
Even when they say you've died
And maybe it's for the best
You're not in this whole mess
Cause you are too good
You wouldn't deserve this
And I know I could never
In a thousand years or ever
Write everything there is about you
Do justice to my most precious
I was hoping
That I'd see her
I'd get to hug her
In the twenty twenties
Even though she'd
Rather not be
She'd be smiling
In the twenty twenties
