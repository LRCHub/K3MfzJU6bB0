How was I supposed to know
This is how it's gonna go?
Thought that
if I put you first enough
We would last for sure,
last for sure (For sure)
Remember our first kiss,
was in a rental car
Now I kinda wish it was a hit
and run
Crazy I let you get this far
But I was just young and dumb
Six years gone down the drain
I guess I'm half to blame
I didn't know,
I didn't know
I'd be wasting my time
Spending my twenties on you (Oh)
I poured my heart in it
Don't get me started
Spend my time wondering why
I spent my twenties on you
Thought I was learning myself
I was just learning you
Is anything black and white
When you're barely twenty-two?
Hold onto you
like a shirt to a sweater
Hung onto you
'cause I didn't know better
I just felt like time was
runnin' out
I could tell
the ship was goin' down
I was so young and dumb
Six years gone down the drain
I guess I'm half to blame
I didn't know,
I didn't know
I'd be wasting my time
Spending my twenties on you (Oh)
I poured my heart in it
Don't get me started
Spend my time wondering why
I spent my twenties on you, oh
I poured my heart in it
Don't get me started
Spend my time wondering why
I spent my twenties on you
