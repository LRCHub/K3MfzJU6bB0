The past is meeting the future
The future is meeting the present
The present is meeting the past
Welcome back!

There's being a moment
In history
When time runs
And the past becomes the present.
I've got this feeling on me
And my body's burning
I know I've got the only
Chance to get through
It's not a deja vu!

It's a new story
With an old rhythm
Come and join the party
Step into the twenties
It's a new story
Maybe it's forbidden
Come and join the party
Jump into the twenties!

The past is meeting the future
The future is meeting the present
The present is meeting the past

Please enjoy the moment
And come with me
To relive the glory
Of the roaring twenties
You've got this feeling like me
Is your body burning?
I think we've got the only
Chance to get through
It's not a deja vu!

The past is meeting the future
The future is meeting the present
The present is meeting the past
Welcome back!

It's a new story
With an old rhythm
Come and join the party
Step into the twenties
It's a new story
Maybe it's forbidden
Come and join the party
Jump into the twenties!

Welcome back!
