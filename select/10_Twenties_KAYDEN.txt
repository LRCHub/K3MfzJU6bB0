(Ha-ha!)

I'm an underachiever
My momma said to go to college, should've believed her
Now I'm laying on the couch, parents wanna throw me out
Girlfriend's blowing up my phone, I don't wanna see her

They said, I was gonna be something great
And I was gonna make the world change
God, if only they knew
I hate to disappoint you (I hate to disappoint you)

No one ever told me
Your twenties could be lonely
I don't know what all the hype's about
How the hell did I get so stressed out?

And no one ever told me
Your twenties could be lonely
I don't know what all the hype's about
How the hell did I get so stressed out?

(Oh, I hate to disappoint you)

I've always been an underachiever
Remember back in high school I would flip off the teachers
Parents caught us on the couch, we were always way too loud
Sneaking through the window 'cause they won't let me see her

Well, I was gonna be something great
If I was gonna make the world change
God, if only they knew
I hate to disappoint you

No one ever told me
Your twenties could be lonely
I don't know what all the hype's about
How the hell did I get so stressed out?

And no one ever told me
Your twenties could be lonely
I don't know what all the hype's about
How the hell did I get so stressed out?

(Oh, I hate to disappoint you)

No one ever told me
Your twenties could be lonely
I don't know what all the hype's about
How the hell did I get so stressed out?

And no one ever told me
Your twenties could be lonely
I don't know what all the hype's about
How the hell did I get so stressed out?
